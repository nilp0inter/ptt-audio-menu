# Agent Notes

## Repository Workflow

- Read `PROMPT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PLAN.md`, `EXECUTION.md`, and `AGENTS.md` at the start of each session when present.
- Keep sessions short and focused.
- Use `rg` / `rg --files` for repository inspection.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual source and documentation edits.
- Leave unrelated untracked files alone; `nixos.qcow2` was present before this session.
- This repository may not have Git author identity configured on a fresh machine. The local config was set from the latest commit author during the 2026-06-19 session.

## Build and Test

- The project uses a Nix flake dev shell.
- Run Rust verification inside the shell:

```sh
nix develop --command cargo fmt --check
nix develop --command cargo test
nix develop --command cargo check
```

- Running `cargo test` directly on a host without dbus development files fails while building `libdbus-sys`.

## Current Code Layout

- `src/main.rs`: application entry point, hardcoded target device address, RFCOMM read loop, raw diagnostic output, parser event output.
- `src/transport.rs`: BlueZ session/adapter setup, RFCOMM Serial Port profile registration, concurrent `connect_profile` and profile request acceptance.
- `src/parser.rs`: token-scanning serial parser, typed raw button/action events, and parser unit tests.
- `src/input.rs`: hardware event normalization, active/control mode tracking, SOS long-press suppression, PTT threshold handling, and input semantics unit tests.
